# Art Book, an EmulationStation theme

**Note**: This is a fork from the RetroPie theme. The main goal here is to make it compatible with
Recalbox Emulationstation, and in a near future, add support to region based logos.

## Details

- Support for custom systems is being removed. Our goal here is not to support custom gamelists(zelda, megaman, taito, etc) but to port this theme to Recalbox.
- Video view will be converted on a simple "box+screenshot+gamelogo view".
- Displays rating, description, # of players, genre, publish date & last played metadata on detailed and video views. Change the "Launch png" since Recalbox uses B not A to launch games :)
- 16x9 resolutions only (tested at 1280x720 and 1920x1080)
